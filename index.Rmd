Here you will find the manual for the prioritizr workshop held at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. **Before you arrive at the workshop, you should make sure that you have correctly [set up your computer for the workshop](#setup) and you have [downloaded the data from here](https://github.com/prioritizr/massey-workshop/raw/master/data.zip). Since we cannot guarantee a stable Internet connection during the workshop, you may be unable to complete the workshop if you have not set up your computer beforehand.**

```{r, include = FALSE}
# set knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(fig.align = "center")
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
