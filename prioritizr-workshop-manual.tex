\chapter{Welcome!}\label{welcome}}

Here you will find the manual for the prioritizr workshop held at Massey University, Palmerston North, New Zealand. \textbf{Before you arrive at the workshop, you should make sure that you have correctly \protect\hyperlink{setup}{set up your computer for the workshop} and you have \href{https://github.com/prioritizr/massey-workshop/raw/master/data.zip}{downloaded the data from here}. Since we cannot guarantee a stable Internet connection during the workshop, you may be unable to complete the workshop if you have not set up your computer beforehand.}

\hypertarget{introduction}{%
\chapter{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

\hypertarget{overview}{%
\section{Overview}\label{overview}}

The aim of this workshop is to help you get started with using the prioritizr R package for systematic conservation planning. It is not designed to give you a comprehensive overview and you will not become an expert after completing this workshop. Instead, we want to help you understand the core principles of conservation planning and guide you through some of the common tasks involved with developing prioritizations. In other words, we want to give you the knowledge base and confidence needed to start applying systematic conservation planning to your own work.

You are not alone in this workshop. If you are having trouble, please put your hand up and one of the instructors will help you as soon as they can. You can also ask the people sitting next to you for help too. \textbf{Most importantly, the code needed to answer the questions in this workshop are almost always located in the same section as the question. So if you are stuck, try rereading the example code and see if you can modify it to answer the question.} Please note that the first thing an instructor will ask you will be ``what have you tried so far?''. We can't help you if you haven't tried anything.

\hypertarget{setup}{%
\section{Setting up your computer}\label{setup}}

You will need to have both R and RStudio installed on your computer to complete this workshop. Although it is not imperative that you have the latest version of RStudio installed, \textbf{you will need the latest version of R installed (i.e.~version 4.0.4)}. Please note that you might need administrative permissions to install these programs. After installing them, you will also need to install some R packages too. Finally, you will also need to download the data for this workshop.

\hypertarget{r}{%
\subsection{R}\label{r}}

The \href{https://www.r-project.org}{R statistical computing environment} can be downloaded from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). Specifically, you can download the latest version of R (version 4.0.4) from here: \url{https://cloud.r-project.org}. Please note that you will need to download the correct file for your operating system (i.e.~Linux, Mac OSX, Windows).

\hypertarget{rstudio}{%
\subsection{RStudio}\label{rstudio}}

\href{https://www.rstudio.com}{RStudio} is an integrated development environment (IDE). In other words, it is a program that is designed to make your R programming experience more enjoyable. During this workshop, you will interact with R through RStudio---meaning that you will open RStudio to code in R. You can download the latest version of RStudio here: \url{http://www.rstudio.com/download}. When you start RStudio, you will see two main parts of the interface:

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{images/rstudio-console} \end{center}

You can type R code into the \emph{Console} and press the enter key to run code.

\hypertarget{r-packages}{%
\subsection{R packages}\label{r-packages}}

An R package is a collection of R code and documentation that can be installed to enhance the standard R environment with additional functionality. Currently, there are over fifteen thousand R packages available on CRAN. Each of these R packages are developed to perform a specific task, such as \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl/index.html}{reading Excel spreadsheets}, \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MODIStsp/index.html}{downloading satellite imagery data}, \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wdpar/index.html}{downloading and cleaning protected area data}, or \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ENMeval/index.html}{fitting environmental niche models}. In fact, R has such a diverse ecosystem of R packages, that the question is almost always not ``can I use R to \ldots?'' but ``what R package can I use to \ldots?''. During this workshop, we will use several R packages. To install these R packages, please enter the code below in the \emph{Console} part of the RStudio interface and press enter. Note that you will require an Internet connection and the installation process may take some time to complete.

The data for this workshop are available online. To download the data, please \href{https://github.com/prioritizr/massey-workshop/raw/master/data.zip}{click on this link} and save the \texttt{data.zip} file to your computer. Next, unzip the \texttt{data.zip} file. You should now have a new folder on your computer called \texttt{"data"} which contains the data files (e.g.~\texttt{pu.shp}).

\hypertarget{further-reading}{%
\section{Further reading}\label{further-reading}}

There is a wealth of resources available for learning how to use R. Although not required for this workshop, I would highly recommend that you read \href{https://r4ds.had.co.nz/}{\emph{R for Data Science} by Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham}. \textbf{This veritable trove of R goodness is freely available online.} If you spend a week going through this book then you will save months debugging and rerunning incorrect code. I would urge any and all ecologists, especially those working on Masters or PhD degrees, to read this book. I even bought this book as a Christmas present for my sister---and, yes, she was happy to receive it! For intermediate users looking to skill-up, I would recommend the \href{http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781593273842.do}{\emph{The Art of R Programming: A Tour of Statistical Software Design} by Norman Matloff} and \href{https://adv-r.hadley.nz/}{\emph{Advanced R} by Hadley Wickham}. Finally, if you wish to learn more about using R as a geospatial information system (GIS), I would recommend \href{https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/}{\emph{Geocomputation with R} by Robin Lovelace, Jakub Nowosad, and Jannes Muenchow} which is also freely available online. I also recommend \href{https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781461476177}{\emph{Applied Spatial Data Analysis} by Roger S. Bivand, Edzer Pebesma, and Virgilio Gómez-Rubio} too.

\hypertarget{data}{%
\chapter{Data}\label{data}}

\hypertarget{starting-out}{%
\section{Starting out}\label{starting-out}}

We will start by opening RStudio. Ideally, you will have already installed both R and Rstudio before the workshop. If you have not done this already, then please see the \protect\hyperlink{setup}{Setting up your computer} section. \textbf{During this workshop, please do not copy and paste code from the workshop manual into RStudio. Instead, please write it out yourself in an R script.} When programming, you will spend a lot of time fixing coding mistakes---that is, debugging your code---so it is best to get used to making mistakes now when you have people here to help you. You can create a new R script by clicking on \emph{File} in the RStudio menu bar, then \emph{New File}, and then \emph{R Script}.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/rstudio-new-script} \end{center}

After creating a new script, you will notice that a new \emph{Source} panel has appeared. In the \emph{Source} panel, you can type and edit code before you run it. You can run code in the \emph{Source} panel by placing the cursor (i.e.~the blinking line) on the desired line of code and pressing \texttt{Control\ +\ Enter} on your keyboard (or \texttt{CMD\ +\ Enter} if you are using an Apple computer). You can save the code in the \emph{Source} panel by pressing \texttt{Control\ +\ s} on your keyboard (or \texttt{CMD\ +\ s} if you are using an Apple computer).

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/rstudio-source} \end{center}

You can also make notes and write your answers to the workshop questions inside the R script. When writing notes and answers, add a \texttt{\#} symbol so that the text following the \texttt{\#} symbol is treated as a comment and not code. This means that you don't have to worry about highlighting specific parts of the script to avoid errors.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# this is a comment and R will ignore this text if you run it}
\CommentTok{# R will run the code below because it does not start with a # symbol}
\KeywordTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"this is not a comment"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "this is not a comment"
\end{verbatim}

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# you can also add comments to the same line of R code too}
\KeywordTok{print}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"this is also not a comment"}\NormalTok{) }\CommentTok{# but this is a comment}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] "this is also not a comment"
\end{verbatim}

\textbf{Remember to save your script regularly to ensure that you don't lose anything in the event that RStudio crashes (e.g.~using \texttt{Control\ +\ s} or \texttt{CMD\ +\ s})!}

\hypertarget{attaching-packages}{%
\section{Attaching packages}\label{attaching-packages}}

Now we will set up our R session for the workshop. Specifically, enter the following R code to attach the R packages used in this workshop.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# load packages}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(prioritizr)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(sf)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(rgdal)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(raster)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(rgeos)}
\KeywordTok{require}\NormalTok{(mapview)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(units)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(scales)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(assertthat)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(gridExtra)}
\KeywordTok{library}\NormalTok{(dplyr)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

You should have already downloaded the data. If you have not already done so, you can \href{https://github.com/prioritizr/massey-workshop/raw/master/data.zip}{download it from here}. After downloading the data, you can unzip the data into a new folder. Next, you will need to set the working directory to this new folder. To achieve this, click on the \emph{Session} button on the RStudio menu bar, then click \emph{Set Working Directory}, and then \emph{Choose Directory}.

\begin{center}\includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/rstudio-wd} \end{center}

\clearpage

Now navigate to the folder where you unzipped the data and select \emph{Open}. You can verify that you have correctly set the working directory using the following R code. You should see the output \texttt{TRUE} in the \emph{Console} panel.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\KeywordTok{file.exists}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/pu.shp"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\begin{verbatim}
## [1] TRUE
\end{verbatim}

\hypertarget{data-import}{%
\section{Data import}\label{data-import}}

Now that we have downloaded the dataset, we will need to import it into our R session. Specifically, this data was obtained from the ``Introduction to Marxan'' course and was originally a subset of a larger spatial prioritization project performed under contract to Australia's Department of Environment and Water Resources. It contains vector-based planning unit data (\texttt{pu.shp}) and the raster-based data describing the spatial distributions of 32 vegetation classes (\texttt{vegetation.tif}) in southern Tasmania, Australia. Please note this dataset is only provided for teaching purposes and should not be used for any real-world conservation planning. We can import the data into our R session using the following code.

\begin{Shaded}
\begin{Highlighting}[]
\CommentTok{# import planning unit data}
\NormalTok{pu_data <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{as}\NormalTok{(}\KeywordTok{read_sf}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/pu.shp"}\NormalTok{), }\StringTok{"Spatial"}\NormalTok{)}

\CommentTok{# format columns in planning unit data}
\NormalTok{pu_data}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{locked_in <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{as.logical}\NormalTok{(pu_data}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{locked_in)}
\NormalTok{pu_data}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{locked_out <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{as.logical}\NormalTok{(pu_data}\OperatorTok{$}\NormalTok{locked_out)}

\CommentTok{# import vegetation data}
\NormalTok{veg_data <-}\StringTok{ }\KeywordTok{stack}\NormalTok{(}\StringTok{"data/vegetation.tif"}\NormalTok{)}
\end{Highlighting}
\end{Shaded}

\clearpage

\hypertarget{planning-unit-data}{%
\section{Planning unit data}\label{planning-unit-data}}

The planning unit data contains spatial data describing the geometry for each planning unit and attribute data with information about each planning unit (e.g.~cost values). Let's investigate the \texttt{pu\_data} object. The attribute data contains 5 columns with contain the following information:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \texttt{id}: unique identifiers for each planning unit
\item
  \texttt{cost}: acquisition cost values for each planning unit (millions of Australian dollars).
\item
  \texttt{status}: status information for each planning unit (only relevant with Marxan)
\item
  \texttt{locked\_in}: logical values (i.e.~\texttt{TRUE}/\texttt{FALSE}) indicating if planning units are covered by protected areas or not.
\item
  \texttt{locked\_out}: logical values (i.e.~\texttt{TRUE}/\texttt{FALSE}) indicating if planning units cannot be managed as a protected area because they contain are too degraded.
\end{itemize}

\section{Vegetation data}\label{vegetation-data}}

The vegetation data describe the spatial distribution of 32 vegetation classes in the study area. This data is in a raster format and so the data are organized using a grid comprising square grid cells that are each the same size. In our case, the raster data contains multiple layers (also called ``bands'') and each layer has corresponds to a spatial grid with exactly the same area and has exactly the same dimensionality (i.e.~number of rows, columns, and cells). In this dataset, there are 32 different regular spatial grids layered on top of each other -- with each layer corresponding to a different vegetation class -- and each of these layers contains a grid with 164 rows, 326 columns, and 53464 cells. Within each layer, each cell corresponds to a 0.967 by 1.02 km square. The values associated with each grid cell indicate the (one) presence or (zero) absence of a given vegetation class in the cell.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-1}}

Before we begin to prioritize areas for protected area establishment, we should first understand how well existing protected areas are conserving our biodiversity features (i.e.~native vegetation classes in Tasmania, Australia). This step is critical: we cannot develop plans to improve conservation of biodiversity if we don't understand how well existing policies are currently conserving biodiversity! To achieve this, we can perform a ``gap analysis''. A gap analysis involves calculating how well each of our biodiversity features (i.e.~vegetation classes in this exercise) are represented (covered) by protected areas. Next, we compare current representation by protected areas of each feature (e.g.~5\% of their spatial distribution covered by protected areas) to a target threshold (e.g.~20\% of their spatial distribution covered by protected areas). This target threshold denotes the minimum amount (e.g.~minimum proportion of spatial distribution) that we need of each feature to be represented in the protected area system. Ideally, targets should be based on an estimate of how much area or habitat is needed for ecosystem function or species persistence. In practice, targets are generally set using simple rules of thumb (e.g.~10\% or 20\%), policy (17\%; \url{https://www.cbd.int/sp/targets/rationale/target-11}) or standard practices (e.g.~setting targets for species based on geographic range size) \citep{r1, r2}.

\hypertarget{feature-abundance}{%
\section{Feature abundance}\label{feature-abundance}}

Now we will perform some preliminary calculations to explore the data. First, we will calculate how much of each vegetation feature occurs inside each planning unit (i.e.~the abundance of the features). To achieve this, we will use the \texttt{problem} function to create an empty conservation planning problem that only contains the planning unit and biodiversity data. We will then use the \texttt{feature\_abundances} function to calculate the total amount of each feature in each planning unit.

The \texttt{abundance\_data} object contains three columns. The \texttt{feature} column contains the name of each feature (derived from \texttt{names(veg\_data)}), the \texttt{absolute\_abundance} column contains the total amount of each feature in all the planning units, and the \texttt{relative\_abundance} column contains the total amount of each feature in the planning units expressed as a proportion of the total amount in the underlying raster data. Since all the raster cells containing vegetation overlap with the planning units, all of the values in the \texttt{relative\_abundance} column are equal to one (meaning 100\%). Now let's add a new column with the feature abundances expressed in area units (i.e.~km\textsuperscript{2}).

After calculating the total amount of each feature in the planning units (i.e.~the features' abundances), we will now calculate the amount of each feature in the planning units that are covered by protected areas (i.e.~feature representation by protected areas). We can complete this task using the \texttt{eval\_feature\_representation\_summary()} function. This function requires (i) a conservation problem object with the planning unit and biodiversity data and also (ii) an object representing a solution to the problem (i.e an object in the same format as the planning unit data with values indicating if the planning units are selected or not).

Similar to the abundance data before, the \texttt{repr\_data} object contains three columns. The \texttt{feature} column contains the name of each feature, the \texttt{absolute\_held} column shows the total amount of each feature held in the solution (i.e.~the planning units covered by protected areas), and the \texttt{relative\_held} column shows the proportion of each feature held in the solution (i.e.~the proportion of each feature's spatial distribution held in protected areas). Since the \texttt{absolute\_held} values correspond to the number of grid cells in the \texttt{veg\_data} object with overlap with protected areas, let's convert them to area units (i.e.~km\textsuperscript{2}) so we can report them.

Now let's investigate how well the species are represented.

\begin{rmdquestion}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the average proportion of the features held in protected areas (hint: use \texttt{mean(table\$relative\_held)} with the correct \texttt{table} name)?
\item
  If we set a target of 10\% coverage by protected areas, how many features fail to meet this target (hint: use \texttt{sum(table\$relative\_held\ \textgreater{}=\ target\_value)} with the correct \texttt{table} name)?
\item
  If we set a target of 20\% coverage by protected areas, how many features fail to meet this target?
\item
  Is there a relationship between the total abundance of a feature and how well it is represented by protected areas (hint: \texttt{plot(abundance\_data\$absolute\_abundance\ \textasciitilde{}\ repr\_data\$relative\_held)})?
\end{enumerate}

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction-2}}

Here we will develop prioritizations to identify priority areas for protected area establishment. Its worth noting that prioritizr is a decision support tool (similar to \href{http://marxan.org/}{Marxan} and \href{https://www.helsinki.fi/en/researchgroups/digital-geography-lab/software-developed-in-cbig\#section-52992}{Zonation}). This means that it is designed to help you make decisions---it can't make decisions for you.

\hypertarget{starting-out-simple}{%
\section{Starting out simple}\label{starting-out-simple}}

To start things off, let's keep things simple. Let's create a prioritization using the \href{https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_min_set_objective.html}{minimum set formulation of the reserve selection problem}. This formulation means that we want a solution that will meet the targets for our biodiversity features for minimum cost. Here, we will set 5\% targets for each vegetation class and use the data in the \texttt{cost} column to specify acquisition costs. Although we strongly recommend using \href{https://www.gurobi.com/}{Gurobi} to solve problems (with \href{https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_gurobi_solver.html}{\texttt{add\_gurobi\_solver}}), we will use the \href{https://prioritizr.net/reference/add_lpsymphony_solver.html}{lpsymphony solver} in this workshop since it is easier to install. The Gurobi solver is much faster than the lpsymphony solver (\href{https://prioritizr.net/articles/gurobi_installation.html}{see here for installation instructions}).

\section{Adding complexity}\label{adding-complexity}}

Our first prioritization suffers many limitations, so let's add additional constraints to the problem to make it more useful. First, let's lock in planing units that are already by covered protected areas. If some vegetation communities are already secured inside existing protected areas, then we might not need to add as many new protected areas to the existing protected area system to meet their targets. Since our planning unit data (\texttt{pu\_da}) already contains this information in the \texttt{locked\_in} column, we can use this column name to specify which planning units should be locked in.

Now, let's compare the solutions.

\begin{rmdquestion}
\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  What is the cost of the planning units selected in \texttt{s2}, \texttt{s3}, and \texttt{s4}?
\item
  How many planning units are in \texttt{s2}, \texttt{s3}, and \texttt{s4}?
\item
  Do the solutions with more planning units have a greater cost? Why (or why not)?
\item
  Why does the first solution (\texttt{s1}) cost less than the second solution with protected areas locked into the solution (\texttt{s2})?
\item
  Why does the third solution (\texttt{s3}) cost less than the fourth solution solution with highly degraded areas locked out (\texttt{s4})?
\end{enumerate}
\end{rmdquestion}

\hypertarget{penalizing-fragmentation}{%
\section{Penalizing fragmentation}\label{penalizing-fragmentation}}

Plans for protected area systems should promote connectivity. However, the prioritizations we have made so far have been highly fragmented. To address this issue, we can add penalties to our conservation planning problem to penalize fragmentation. These penalties work by specifying a trade-off between the primary objective (here, solution cost) and fragmentation (i.e.~total exposed boundary length) using a penalty value. If we set the penalty value too low, then we will end up with a solution that is nearly identical to the previous solution. If we set the penalty value too high, then prioritizr will (1) take a long time to solve the problem and (2) we will end up with a solution that contains lots of extra planning units that are not needed. This is because the minimizing fragmentation is considered so much more important than solution cost that the optimal solution is simply to select as many planning units as possible.

As a rule of thumb, we generally want penalty values between 0.00001 and 0.01. However, finding a useful penalty value requires calibration. The ``correct'' penalty value depends on the size of the planning units, the main objective values (e.g.~cost values), and the effect of fragmentation on biodiversity persistence. Let's create a new problem that is similar to our previous problem (\texttt{p4})---except that it contains boundary length penalties and a slightly higher optimality gap to reduce runtime (default is 0.1)---and solve it. Since our planning unit data is in a spatial format (i.e.~vector or raster data), prioritizr can automatically calculate the boundary data for us.

\begin{rmdquestion}

  Try setting the penalty value to 0.000000001 (i.e.~\texttt{1e-9}) instead of 0.0005. What is the cost of the solution now? Is it different from the fourth solution (\texttt{s4}) (hint: try plotting the solutions to visualize them)? Is this is a useful penalty value? Why (or why not)?
\item
  Try setting the penalty value to 0.5. What is the cost of the solution now? Is it different from the fourth solution (\texttt{s4}) (hint: try plotting the solutions to visualize them)? Is this a useful penalty value? Why (or why not)?
